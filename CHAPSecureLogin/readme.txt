Do not show password, during login, on an insecure channel (without SSL)

== Description ==

The scope of this plugin is the encrypted trasmission of your password over an insicure channel. The plugin implements the CHAP protocol (you can find a very basic description of it here [CHAP protocol](http://www.devarticles.com/c/a/JavaScript/Building-a-CHAP-Login-System-Encrypting-Data-in-the-Client/)). This is particularly useful when your server or hoster doesn't use SSL for secure connection. At login time, the only unencrypted sent information is the username; the password is hashed with a random number generated by the server and trasmitted encrypted.
