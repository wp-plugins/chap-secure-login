Do not show password, during login, on an insecure channel (without SSL)

== Description ==

This plugin permit that your password, when you try to login, is not trasmitted unencrypted. This plugin implements the CHAP protocol for trust your login on an insecure channel (for example when your server that host your blog don't use SSL for secure connection). So when you login only information that the browser trasmit unencrypted is your username, the password is hashed with a random number generated by the server and so is trasmitted encrypted.
